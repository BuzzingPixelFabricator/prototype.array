# Fabricator Array Prototype Methods

While this component is designed with the [BuzzingPixel Fabricator Build Process](https://github.com/tjdraper/buzzing-pixel-fabricator) in mind, it can be used anywhere (in theory).

## `myArr.filterUnique()`

Modifies the array so that it only contains unique items.

## `myArr.getUnique()`

Returns only unique items in the array.

## `myArr.pushUnique('myVal')`

Only pushes the item into the array if the value is unique (not already in the array).
